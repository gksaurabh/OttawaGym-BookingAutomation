This project was built to automate the process of booking a gym appointment at any of the Ottawa City Gyms/Weightrooms.

Prior to running this code, you may want to update your
  name
  phone number
  email
  desired time
  link to the booking site for a particular gym

variables within the index.js file.

This was built using puppeteer and Node.js

Hope you have fun!

Special thanks to Chethin Manage for proposing the idea!
